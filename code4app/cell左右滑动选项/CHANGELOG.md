- Feature: add preservesSelectionStatus property that allows to control whether selection/highlight is changed when swiped.
- Feature: add keepButtonsSwiped property to Swipe settings
- Feature: new delegate method: shouldHideSwipeOnTap:(CGPoint) point. Now you can cancel to hide opened swipe depending on the tap point
